## Overview
- **Description:** Monitor live [ArcDps](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/) logs, parse data using [Elite Insights](https://github.com/baaron4/GW2-Elite-Insights-Parser), and send descriptive WvW fight reports to a Discord channel and optionally a Twitch channel.  This program is open source. The provided data includes:
   - Squad Summary, Enemy Summary
   - Player Damage, Down Contribution, Spike Damage
   - Cleanses, Strips
   - Heals and Barrier (if setup)
   - Defensive and Offensive Boons
   - Outgoing Downs and Kills
   - Outgoing CCs and Interrupts
   - Enemy Top Skill Dmg, Enemy Breakdown
   - Link to [WvW Dps Report](https://dps.report/)
   - Squad Damage Graph
- **Credit:** This app was originally developed to mimic the "Indo-bot" (developed by Tiff).  This is a completely separate implementation made for broader use.  Major credit to the Elite Insights, ArcDps devs and Micca with the WvW Reports website.

## Troubleshooting
#### > The program is not doing anything after fights complete.
  1. Ensure ArcDps is generating log files.  By default this will be in your user profile's Documents folder:
     - Typically under:  C:\Users\\<User Name\>\Documents\Guild Wars 2\addons\arcdps
  1. Double check the instructions above regarding ArcDps options.  Ensure the squad and enemy size is above the minimum.
  1. Ensure in the MzFightReporter Settings tab the 'ArcDps Log Folder #1' is correct.  If necessary edit the path accordingly and apply.
#### > It's not working, I'm stuck.
  1. Feel free to ask questions in the [Support Discord](https://discord.gg/5JfZ3qpW3Q).

## Enable Healing Stats

1. Enter Guild Wars 2 and open the ArcDps options (alt-shift-t).  Under 'Extensions' tab choose the 'healing_stats' then check 'log healing' and 'enable live sharing'.
   - Note: To view the in-game heal window check the 'peers outgoing' option.
   - Note: Healing stats does contribute to larger arcdps logs therefore it is more resource intensive.

## About the Data
### Outgoing CC's
Elite Insights provides a data point called appliedCrowdControl which indicates a total count of hard CC's.  A hard CC is when an enemy endures a temporary full loss of control having only a stun break to resolve early.
- **Ranking Formula**: HardCC (x10) + SoftCC + Immob (x5) + Interrupts (x5)
- Hard CC's includes: launch, knockback, knockdown, pull, sink, float, stun, fear, taunt
- Soft CC's includes: daze, chill, cripple, slow, blind, weakness
- Immobs can be considered a Soft CC but due to it's impact this attribute is separate.
- Daze could be considered a Hard CC however ArcDps restricts Hard CC as a 'full loss of control'.
### Limitations
Some data points are not provided due to a limitation in the game, arcdps or EI.
- **Healing**:  Only players using the Heal Addon on their side with Live Sharing enabled will be represented.
- **Long Fights**: Fights exceeding ~15 minutes run the risk of not reporting and/or not uploading.  Settings exist to manage the maximum upload size.
